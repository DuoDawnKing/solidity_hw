In this code, we will be setting up two different accounts that will be used to deposit and withdraw various cryptocurrencies. In the code, we enabled contract balance, which will be used to display both accounts, withdraw variables to display data on what account had the last withdraw and by what amount, and set up the variables for the addresses as account 1 and account 2. For the two addresses, i deposited 1 wei, 5 wei, 5 ether.

The deposit was successful for all accounts. When i withdraw from the accounts i needed to add more ether to withdraw the 10 ether from account 2.

![account 2 withdraw - 10 eth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100724428/181653549-c4a3f55b-a765-4f0c-b472-50e4c55943fc.PNG)

The transfer were successful and the deposit and withdraws were successful. 

Warning, the transfer was automatically set to wei, so i had to find a converter online to figure out how much ether equals to wei
